Sharing is permitted — users may copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
Adaptation is permitted — users may remix, transform, and build upon the material.
Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
NonCommercial — You may not use the material, or derivatives thereof, for commercial purposes such as productization; resale;
incorporation into, or integration with, a product or service for resale; or other activities involving renumeration or trade.

Usage by the following classes of entities is prohibited: security software product companies including but not limited to EDR, NDR, XDR or SIEM product companies; search, database, data aggregation and / or data lake product companies; public cloud providers, SaaS and PaaS product, service or platform companies not otherwise specified.

This provision shall not be construed to prohibit use by commercial entities, provided that the material or its derivatives are not incorporated into a product or service that is sold or resold for monetary gain or remuneration. No additional restrictions may be applied — you may not impose legal terms or technological measures that restrict others from engaging in any activities permitted by this license. For the purposes of this license, “monetary gain or remuneration” includes any activities involving the exchange of money, goods, or services, whether for profit or cost recovery. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Generating revenue through the sale, resale, or licensing of the material or its derivatives.
2. Charging fees to recover costs associated with the material’s use, integration, or distribution.

This does not include incidental reimbursement for actual expenses incurred during noncommercial activities, such as academic or research use, provided no profit is generated. 

All terms, conditions, and restrictions of this license, including the prohibition on commercial use and incorporation into products or services, apply equally to derivative works based on the licensed material, including modifications, adaptations, or extensions. If any provision of this license is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions of the license shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be construed, to the extent possible, to reflect the original intent of the parties, and if not possible, shall be deemed severed from this license without affecting the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.

      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
